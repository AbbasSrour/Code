          <dt><strong>Gentle Hatha Yoga </strong></dt>
          <dd>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the
            practice of yoga, this 60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on
            asana (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and guided
            meditation to foster your mind and body connection. </dd>
          <dt><strong>Vinyasa Yoga</strong></dt>
          <dd>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are
            welcome to sample this 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized
            movement—you will inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga
            poses. </dd>
          <dt><strong>Restorative Yoga </strong></dt>
          <dd>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses that are
            supported by a chair or wall. This calming, restorative experience is suitable
            for students of any level of experience. This practice can be a perfect way to
            help rehabilitate an injury. </dd>

        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>“Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms
          up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip
          away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting
          position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have
          in life. Namaste.”</p>
